# The-A-Team CampusFit
The problem space we identified revolves around enhancing the physical health management of university students, acknowledging the unique challenges they face in balancing academics and well-being. In the fast-paced environment of the university, time constraints and the lack of individualized guidance contribute to the difficulty of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This necessitated the development of a comprehensive solution that incorporates fitness monitoring with a configurable scheduling component to enable students to effectively manage their physical health.

Important obstacles, such as crammed schedules and the absence of personalized health advice, prompted us to create a fitness application tailored to the requirements of university students. The objective was to create a product that not only monitors fitness activities but also includes a scheduler that enables users to plan exercises around their busy schedules. This addresses the time constraints faced by students and facilitates the seamless incorporation of health recommendations into their hectic schedules.

The target audience consists of 18 to 25-year-old university students pursuing a variety of degrees and frequently juggling part-time or full-time employment alongside their studies. The solution satisfies their desire for a user-friendly application that effortlessly integrates their schedule with health recommendations, providing comprehensive health reports and individualized workout suggestions based on individual goals and biometric data.

Our work plan includes extensive research and feedback methodologies, such as user research and requirements assessment, competitor analysis, and gap identification. This method seeks to gain insight into students' daily activities, problem points, and the efficacy of existing solutions. The development schedule includes phases for research, prototype creation, user testing, and iterations to ensure that the final product meets user expectations and preferences.

In essence, our fitness application is a comprehensive solution that addresses the unique challenges confronted by university students. It aims to equip them with the knowledge and resources they need to make well-informed decisions regarding their physical health within the constraints of their busy schedules.
